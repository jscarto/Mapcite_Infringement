Recently, Mapcite stole my article (http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/) which they republished as if it were their own: http://www.mapcite.com/posts/2015/february/bivariate-choropleth-maps-a-how-to-guide.aspx

I was never contact and never gave them permission to do this. They even used my imagery, stealing my bandwidth to advertise their product. As you'll notice, I didn't let this slide.

But I also noticed I wasn't alone in being ripped off like this.

# Did Mapcite steal your content? Here are 3,116 instances of the same 'Courtesy of...' line they used when stealing my article.

I only had a few min to spare so I grabbed ever occurance of 'Courtesy of' plus the next 40 characters. If you're on this list, I encourage you to:

* Find your article on their site
* Issue a formal [DMCA takedown](https://nppa.org/page/5617) to their host, [WebFusion](http://www.webfusion.com) by contacting their abuse department at [abuse@webfusion.com](mailto:abuse@webfusion.com)

Even if your name is not on the list, please help content creators by spreading this information, unfollowing @MAPCITE on twitter (if you follow them), and sticking up for copyright holders against this sleazy practice.
