Recently, Mapcite stole my article (http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/) which they republished as if it were their own: http://www.mapcite.com/posts/2015/february/bivariate-choropleth-maps-a-how-to-guide.aspx

I was never contact and never gave them permission to do this. They even used my imagery, stealing my bandwidth to advertise their product. As you'll notice, I didn't let this slide.

But I also noticed I wasn't alone in being ripped off.

# Did Mapcite steal your content? Here are ~~3,116~~ 3,112 instances of the same 'Courtesy of...' line they used when stealing my article.

I only had a few minutes to spare so I grabbed every occurrence of 'Courtesy of' (cleaned up by @cartocalypse on Twitter).

* Find your article on their site
* Issue a formal [DMCA takedown](https://nppa.org/page/5617) to their host, [WebFusion](http://www.webfusion.com) by contacting their abuse department at [abuse@webfusion.com](mailto:abuse@webfusion.com)

Even if your name is not on the list, please help content creators by spreading this information, unfollowing @MAPCITE on twitter (if you follow them), and sticking up for copyright holders against this sleazy practice.

In 2011, he and his co-founders trained fake Twitter accounts to tweet at several thousand humans, deceiving them into tweeting back at the bots and eventually at one another. When the experiment ended, they found the bots had effectively wired their human targets together.
